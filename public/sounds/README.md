# Sound Files for Voting Demo

This folder should contain the following sound files:

1. **correct_1.mp3** - Plays when the correct candidate button is pressed
2. **error.mp3** - Plays when an incorrect/dummy button is pressed  
3. **last.mp3** - Plays when all 4 units have been voted on (completion sound)

## How to add sound files:

You can either:
- Download sound effects from free sources like freesound.org
- Use the original sound files from the PHP website if available
- Create simple beep sounds using online tools

Place the MP3 files in this directory (`public/sounds/`) with the exact names listed above.

## Temporary Solution:

The app will work without sound files - it will just fail silently if the files are missing.
